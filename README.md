### Bayesian Inference

The two foremost aims of classical regression are to assess the structure and magnitude of the relationship between variables. Despite the aforementioned benefits, unlike classical regression, which only offers a point estimate and a confidence interval, Bayesian regression offers the whole spectrum of inferential solutions. The results of this study demonstrate the Bayesian approach's suitability for regression tasks and its advantage in accounting for additional a priori data, which often strengthens studies.
